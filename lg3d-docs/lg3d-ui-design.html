<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    
<p>This is an evolving document that discusses the Project Looking
Glass 3D Desktop Environment visual design. </p>
   
<p>Instead of starting a generic 3D application design discussion and
ending up going nowhere, we first focus on a 3D application which we
are sure we need to develop; the 3D Desktop Environment.  This
document follows this approach. </p>
   
<p>Sticking to the right focus is the most important aspect of the
discussion. Sections 2 and 3 try to identify the right focus.
Following those, we focus on the 3D desktop environment for now, and
try to identify the overall paradigms and metaphors used.  Then we
proceed to discussions on the user interface design.</p>
   
<p>While our initial focus is on the desktop environment, we need to
keep a broader view point regarding 3D user interface in general in
order to make the metaphor and design extensible enough to accommodate
future, evolving extensions. Section 6 is intended to keep track of
possible ideas for future extensions, so that we won't get lost just
by seeing a tree.
</p>
   
<p>Other topics including software component design, etc.  are outside
of the scope of this document.</p>

<h3>2. Design Directions</h3>
    
<ol>
  <li> Focus on a 3D application which we are sure we need to develop;
       the Project Looking Glass 3D Desktop Environment.
    <p> Do not target at a generic 3D widget set API at the beginning.
  Initially focus on how we can leverage 3D in order to "improve" the
  user experience in the context of desktop operations.  Here
  "improve" includes productivity as well as fun-to-use aspects.  Once
  we successfully identified a compelling new 3D usage model in this
  specific instance, we then extrapolate from this a more general or
  global paradigm for 3D applications. </p> </li> <li> Stick with an
  Ordinary Display and Ordinary Pointing Device
   
    <p> 2D Display, A mouse, a keyboard and sound-generation
   capability.[3] (Note: This is a goal for the early stage, in order
   to get things going.  The system needs to be designed for future
   extensibility of more 3D oriented input and output devices in mind)
   </p>
  </li>

  <li> Develop Global 3D Paradigm and Metaphor
    <p> It is important to develop a cohesive 3D interface paradigm[2]
  3D version of the WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device)
  paradigm.
    </p>
       
    <p> Giving users unlimited freedom to do anything they want may
   seem like the most beneficent act of engineering possible, but it's
   not.[3] Creating "reality" by consistently defining constraints
   across the UI helps. </p>
       
    <p> It is inherently difficult to understand 3D spaces and to
   perform actions in free space.  Limit the required degrees of
   freedom for input whenever possible, and provide physical or
   virtual constraints to help guide user input.[2] </p>
       
    <p> Window, Icon and Menu of the current style are designed under
   the constraints of older technology.  Revisit those and think how
   to achieve the objectives in better ways by applying 3D
   capabilities and what we learned about human computer interaction
   since then. </p>
       
    <p> Try to solve the overall paradigm and metaphor for a
   consistent and cohesive way to map the unique attributes of 3D
   capability to a desktop environment.  This is the key to achieving
   something here that has the potential to redefine how users
   interact with computers. </p> </li> 

 <li> Not 3D But Usability Focus

  <p>Better to fight for two versus three clicks than to debate 2D
   versus 3D. Navigation complexity is a key determinant of user
   success.[1]</p>
     
  <p>Think about how we can leverage capabilities like 3D, cheap
   scaling, translucency and access to clients' scene graph to
   simplify user operations. </p>
     
  <p>No usability regression from today's 2D UI.  Do not exacerbate
   the existing problems with 2D UI by introducing additional ones
   including difficulty of 3D navigation, etc. </p></li>

 <li>Pay strong attention to elegance

  <p>Simplicity and consistency.  "Featuritis is a principal and well
   known disease of software..."[4] Beauty is more important in
   computing than anywhere else in technology because of its
   complexity.  Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity.[4]
   Except when it is bringing about new world orders, beautiful
   technology hardly matters at all.[4] (i.e. it matters when...)</p>
 </li>
 <li>Iterative Usability Tests and Design Refinements

  <p>Three "pillars of successful user interface design": guideline
    documents, user interface software tools, and expert review and
    usability testing.[2]</p> 
 </li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Design Guidelines</h3>
   
<p>This section lists useful design guidelines.  These are supposed to
be applied under the global 3D paradigm and metaphor we follow.
</p>
    
<ol>
  <li>Provide Simplified User Navigation[1][3]
    
    <p>Target-based travel is very simple from the user's point of view.[2]</p>
  </li>
  <li>Provide Simplified Object Manipulation[1][3]
    <p>Three basic tasks: object selection, object positioning, and
     object rotation.[2] Locking object manipulation to a specific
     axis would greatly help mapping functionality and properties to
     an object in a globally consistent way. </p> </li> <li>Permit
     Rich User Feedback

    <p>Prompt, meaningful feedback for user actions.[1] Smooth
     transition of visuals.  A sound could substitute for the feel of
     pressing a button.[2] Pay attention to "disciplined visual
     richness that is characteristics of fine design."[4] Affect
     changes the operating parameters of cognition: positive affect
     enhances creative, breadth-first thinking [9]</p> </li>
     <li>Permit Rich User Actions on Objects
   
    <p>Save, copy, annotate, share, editing[1]</p>
  </li>
  <li>Organize Groups of Items in Aligned Structures
    <p>To allow rapid visual search[1], selection and manipulation.
     Provide Overviews so users can see the big picture.[1]
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Enable Users to Construct Visual Groups to Support Spatial Recall[1]
    <p>Spatial knowledge consists of landmark, procedural, 
     and survey knowledge.[2] </p>
  </li>
</ol>
    
<a name="metaphor"></a> 
<h3>4. Designing Global 3D Paradigm and Metaphor</h3>
    
<p><i>Note: This section is still very rough.</i></p>
   
<p>Initially, we focus on trying to figure out how 3D can be utilized
to create compelling new ways to interact with the features and
functionality of basic desktop operations.  Once we create a
successful design implementation, we can extrapolate a more general or
global paradigm.
</p>
   
<p>First, we investigate the current desktop environemt and understand
what the user really wants to achieve.  Then we identify opportunities
for improvements.? Then we discuss proposed global 3D paradigm and
metaphor. </p>
   
<h4>4.1 What Current Desktop Environemt Provides</h4>
   
<ul>
    <li>Assign rectangular shaped regions for application UI drawing</li>
    <li>Move a window -- by dragging the top of frame</li>
    <li>Resize a window -- by dragging a part of frame</li>
    <li>Minimize, maximize, close a window -- by pushing buttons on the top</li>
    <li>Z-order management -- by mouse interaction</li>
    <li>Keyinput focus management -- by mouse interaction</li>
    <li>Window status display -- taskbar</li>
    <li>Desktop shortcuts of documents and applications</li>
    <li>Start up cascading menu</li>
    <li>Launching application by drag and dropping a document to an
      application short cut</li>
    <li>Simple history -- recently used documents</li>
    <li>Virtual desktop</li>
    <li>Mini applications on taskbar</li>
    <li>Background</li>
    <li>Screen saver</li>
</ul>
    
<h4>4.2 What the User Really Wants To Do</h4>
   
<ul>
    <li>Start applications</li>
    <li>Manage applications</li>
    <li>Operate on documents</li>
    <li>Organize documents</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
    
<h4>4.3 Opportunities for Improvements</h4>
   
<ul>
  <li>Shortcomings of WIMP in general
    <ul>
    <li>Designed when not many elements are needed to be handled
      <ul>
        <li>Resulting in abuse of menu, e.g., in start-up menu</li>
        <li>Windows thrashing[5][6]
        <p>
          Windows obscure each other in Z-order, user needs to constantly
          arrange and rearrange windows to get access to a particular window.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Limited screen space for unlimited windows
        <p>
          Virtual Desktop technology is used to address the the
          problem, but a greater number of desktops (more than 4) imposes
          too great a cognitive load on the user.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>Lack of multi-window operations for fast arrangement of
        information.[8]</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Designed when multiple tasks at one time is not common
       <ul>
         <li>Switching between tasks involves dozens of operations (iconifying,
             opening, moving and resizing windows). [7]</li>
         <li>Seeing multiple tasks/documents simultaneously takes many steps
             (opening windows, moving and resizing them, and scrolling).</li>
         <li>It's not easy to find a particular task/application from a great
             number of tasks/applications. </li>
         <li>There is not an efficient way provided to show multiple related
             windows out of many windows opened on the screen. </li>
         <li>Occupies users' cognitive resources by working on computer  
             domain operations rather than task domain operations.</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>No context-awareness integrated[9]
       <ul>
         <li>Lack of unified framework for information organization and
            coordination according to users' roles.</li>
         <li>Lack of a visual, spatial layout that matches semantics.</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
    
<h3>4.4 Proposed Global 3D Paradigm and Metaphor</h3>
    
<p><i>This is the key section that needs to be worked out.</i></p>
    
<a name="design"></a> 
<h3>5. 3D Window Manager User Interface Design</h3>
    
<p>Assumption: the Project Looking Glass proof-of-concept demo hit
some good points based on the feedback.  So, it should have done
something right. </p>
   
<p>First, decompose the demo UI and reconstruct it under the global 3D
paradigm and metaphor we identified.  During the process, try to find
out what is good, and preserve those areas. Try to identify and
improve things that were bad. </p>
   
<p>In order to move forward efficiently under resource constraints,
first we focus on what needs to be fixed in the proof-of-concept demo.
Then talk about what to add. By keeping this iterative process,
hopefully we can include the focus group usability study. </p>
    
<h4>5.1 What to Fix in the Proof-of-concept Demo</h4>
    
<p><i>to be completed</i></p>
    
<h4>5.2 What to Add to the Proof-of-concept Demo</h4>
    
<p><i>to be completed</i></p>
