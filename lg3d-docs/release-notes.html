<h3><a name="Overview_of_the_changes"></a>1. Overview of the changes</h3>

This section provides an overview of the major changes which have been made to Project Looking Glass since the previous
release (version 0.8.1). 

<h4><a name="lg_gdm_linux"></a>1.1 LG session is now available in the gdm login selector (Linux only)</h4>
On Linux systems a Looking Glass session type is added to the gdm desktop session chooser when you run the postinstall
script during installation of the megabundle. (Note: this is done for you automatically if you install the 
LG debian package).
<br />


<h3><a name="Limitations"></a>2. Known Limitations</h3>
This section describes some of issues and problems you should be aware of 
when running Release 1.0.

<h4><a name="amd64_bad"></a>2.1 The Linux AMD64 configuration is not supported </h4>
Release 1.0 is not supported on this configuration. There are some 
serious bugs on this configuration caused by the mixing of 32 and 64 bit 
components.
