<h2>NVIDIA Driver Installation Tips for Linux</h2>

<br />

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>First of all, assume that your system is going to have to build the
 drivers from source, and make sure you have the kernel sources, compilers
 and binutils installed.  If you've set your machine up to be a developer
platform, all this should already be there.  Adding this software if you
didn't install it initially is usually quite simple and can be done with
the GUI tools supplied by the distributor.  For Sun's JDS, you'll find, under
the <b>Launch</b> button menu, <b>Applications</b> &gt; <b>System Tools</b>
&gt; <b>Install</b></p>
    </li>
    
    <li><p>Then you'll need to semi-build the kernel source - not the whole
thing, just enough of the preamble to building for the right files
to be put in place. The simplest way is to cd to <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">/usr/src/linux</font> and run first 
<i>make cloneconfig</i> and then <i>make dep</i>.  But you can also 
copy the files from <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">/boot</font> 
to the correct places in this source tree and edit them, if you're stuck 
for disk space:</p>
   	  
<blockquote><small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">  cp /boot/vmlinuz.config
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.19-SuSE/.config</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	  cp /boot/vmlinuz.autoconf.h
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.19-SuSE/include/linux/autoconf.h</font></small><br /><br />
    &amp; edit <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">/usr/src/linux-2.4.19-SuSE/include/linux/version.h</font>
 to match "<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">uname -r</font>".<br />
  </blockquote>
   </li>

    <li><p>Go to <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html</a>
 and click on      the latest version for your platform.&nbsp; This will
probably  be Linux IA32 for Intel or AMD x86 chip.</p>
   
<blockquote><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; In the case of GeForce 3 cards, it's been
found that only the older "123" drivers seem to work for them.  If you have a 3, download the following files:<br />
    <br />
    <small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">                
       NVIDIA_GLX-1.0-3123.tar.gz<br />
                          NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-3123.tar.gz</font></small><br />
    <br />
        and install using these sources instead.  Otherwise, continue with
 the next few steps.<br />
  </blockquote>
    </li>
   
    <li><p>Download the *.run file that it takes you to, and read the instructions
      but don't try to run it yet.  The README linked to from here is also
 very useful.  Put the *.run file in an easy-to-reach place.  If you
see more than one, take the one with the highest pkg number.</p>
    </li>
   
    <li><p>To help you compare the 3D speed of your system before and after
this  procedure, you can try running some 3D program to see how well it performs
 with software 3D.  XScreenSaver is installed on most Linux and UNIX systems,
 so a good option for this is to run <i>xscreensaver-demo</i>, select <b>GLPlanet</b>
 (for a good example) or <b>Sproingies</b> from the list, and then click
    <b>Preview.</b>   After watching it perform full screen for a while,
click a mouse button to get back to the normal screen.  We'll be doing this
again later.  Also try glxgears - it will print frame rates every 5 seconds,
giving you a better  comparison.</p>
    </li>
   
    <li><p>Log out to the normal login screen, and then type Ctrl-Alt-F2, which 
will take you to a new virtual console.  Here you should log in as root, and
type init 3, which will drop you to a safe, multi user mode without the X environment.</p>
    </li>
   
    <li><p>When the stopping services text stops printing, press Return and
you should get a prompt back.  Next, type "pkill gdm" to ensure nothing else
is using X.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><p>Now run the downloaded script, by typing, for instance:</p>
   
<blockquote><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>      sh
 NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2.run</small></font></big><br />
  </blockquote>
   
<blockquote> depending on what the file is called.  It's a shell
 script, so the initial "sh" is important.  Walk through the
 text-based install.  For Sun's JDS, there isn't a pre-compiled
 binary, so it must build one.  If you're going to do this, you need
 to make sure you have already installed the kernel sources if you
 haven't done so already.  They should be on the distribution
 media.</blockquote>
</li>

    <li><p>If you're using the Java Desktop System distribution on an Athlon 
PC you should edit the following file, so that you don't get errors about 
the version of the kernel sources not matching your running kernel:</p>
   
<blockquote><small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">       /usr/src/linux-2.4.*/include/linux/version.h</font></small><br />
  </blockquote>
   
<blockquote>      Change line 1 to end with "-athlon" as follows for one
test system:<br />
  </blockquote>
     
<blockquote><small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">       #define
 UTS_RELEASE "2.4.19-4GB-athlon"<br />
    </font></small></blockquote>
   
<blockquote>      i.e.  make it match the output of "uname -r"<br />
  </blockquote>
   
<blockquote>Once the NVIDIA install script has finished, it will tell you
 that if you're running SuSE you should run SaX2 to complete the setup. 
This  is also true for Sun's JDS, so I'll walk through it here.  For other
platforms  you'll need to edit the XF86Config file to replace "nv" with "nvidia"
and  maybe other things.  See the README link off the NVIDIA website (<a
 href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux.html</a>)
 and the installation notes that best match your configuration on the Project Looking
 Glass website.</blockquote>
    </li>
   
    <li><p>So, now run SaX2.  Some people have said that using sax2 -m 0=nvidia
 helps speed this step.  A low-res X session should start, and you should
end up faced with the SaX2 GUI.  You need to step in turn through the options
 under Desktop - the others shouldn't bother you just now.
In order, these are: 
</p>
        
<ul>
   <li>     
    <b><a name="Monitor:"></a>Monitor:</b>
   
<p>Select your model of monitor in the first tab, or as close
 as you can get.  Then click on the 3rd tab, <b>Expert,</b> and change the 
choice box at the top to UseFrameBufferTiming.  Without this setting, I've 
had real trouble getting SaX2 and XF86 to allow me to use the resolutions 
I want on these cards.  Then click <b>Finish</b> to get back to the main
screen.</p>
   </li>
 
   <li>     
    <b>Graphics card</b>:
   
<p>Click [<b>Change Configuration</b>] and delete the card 
that's currently set. This is set up for the old driver, and it's easier to
configure the new drivers this way.  Then click <b>Add new card</b>... and
select NVIDIA as Vendor and pick your card from the list supplied on the
right, and <b>Ok</b> that.</p>
   
<p>If you put the "-m 0=nvidia" argument to sax2 at the start,
 this bit might not be necessary - but check it to see.</p>
   </li>

    <li><b>Colors and Resolutions</b>:
   
<p>Click <b>Properties</b> and in the Colors tab choose the 
color depth you want.  I'd recommend 24 bit, as GeForce cards are optimised 
for it. You'll then be thrown straight to the Resolutions tab for that color 
depth.  Pick the highest resolution you can bear, and the deselect all the 
ones below it (scrolling back down if necessary).  This can be painful, but 
a number of run-time issues are solved by doing this. If the res. you want
 isn't there, you can try adding it in the "Expert" tab.</p>
   
<p>Then click OK to confirm changes. </p>
</li>
   
    <li><b>Virtual Resolution:</b>

<p>Only if you want to!</p></li>

    <li><b>3D Acceleration:</b>
   
<p>If you've correctly set the Graphics card to <b>nvidia,</b>
 this should now say <b>Enabled.</b>  If not, it will say <b>Not configured</b>. 
 There's little point trying to fix this here, when the problem is in the 
configuration of the graphics card.  It's even possible for sax2 to misread 
this, when the NVIDIA driver is being used, and say unavailable or not enabled
 when it is to both.  Don't worry too much just yet.</p>
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><p>If at any point during the above you're told that the resolution
you've selected isn't supported by your monitor, then take careful note
of this.  It generally means that either you're trying too hard for your
hardware, or that you haven't configured the monitor properly.  Pay special
attention to the comments I make in the <a href="#Monitor:">Monitor</a> section
above, and try other options in that Expert tab pulldown list. If you see
this dialogue then SaX2 has thrown away your monitor configuration to discipline
you for suggesting such a thing!</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Once everything is happy, click <b>Finalize</b>.  You are now in
the hands of the Graphics Gremlins, and on your own.  With luck, you'll get
offered the chance to test the configuration, and on doing so, get to see
the blue background and grey screen size boxes, with an "Idle timer" in
the top left.  This is where you get to stretch and move the display to
best fit your monitor,  but if you wait too long, it will fail out, due to
that timer.  Note that the menu top right of the resize dialogue lets you
select by how much you are changing the settings.  Try to get the height
right, and then the width,  and then go back to the height, and finally move
it about until it's right.   Note that it's controlling this by tweaking
the frequencies very mildly, and so changes to one will also effect the other
setting. So it's a slow crawl to as close to good as you can get.  You'll
also see the resolution and frequencies being used on this box.  If the resolution
here doesn't match what you asked for, see the previous paragraph.</p>
   </li>
   
   <li><p>When you've got that, click out, and back at the Test dialogue, click 
    <b>Save,</b> and you should be done and get dropped back to a text prompt.</p></li>
 
   <li><p>Note: SAX2 routinely breaks important OpenGL symlinks from the NVIDIA
      driver set. Therefore, the recommended course of action is to:
<ul>
<li>Install NVIDIA drivers using their installer,</li>
<li>Configure color depth and resolution using SAX2 (24 Bit required),</li>
<li>Re-Install NVIDIA drivers to fix broken links.</li>
</ul>
</li>

   <li><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DRIVER VERSION 8756:</b> 
<br><br>
<A NAME="ALLOWGLXWITHCOMPOSITE"></A>
If you are using version 8756
of the NVIDIA driver, you should do the following additional operations:
<ul>
<li>If the file <span style="font-family: courier New,Courier,monospace;">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</span> doesn't exist, make a symlink with this name which points 
to your X11 configuration file, which is typically <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/etc/X11/XF86Config</span>. For example:
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
            # cd /etc/X11
<br>
            # ln -s XF86Config xorg.conf
</span>
</li>
<br>
<li>
Edit <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</span> and find the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">"Device"</span> section that loads the NVIDIA driver. 
It should look something like this:
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
            Section "Device"
<br>
            BoardName    "0x032B"
<br>
            BusID        "9:0:0"
<br>
            Driver       "nvidia"
<br>
            Identifier   "Device[0]"
<br>
            VendorName   "NVidia"
<br>
            EndSection
</span>
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
Insert the following line after the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">VendorName</span> line:
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
            Option "AllowGLXWithComposite" "true"
</span>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
	  
</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>A good initial test of these new settings is to try typing startx.
 if all is well, X will start up, first showing you the NVIDIA splash screen 
(and how wonderful this is to see after hours of fighting) and then a very 
simple window manager.  From here you can right-click a menu to get a xterm 
up, and type xdpyinfo|more to see how you're configured.  You're looking to
see what resolution is set, what colour-depth is set, and that NVIDIA-GLX 
is in the Extensions list.  If all is well, use the menu to Exit back to the
text console.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Once you're ready to get back to normal operation, type "init 5" and
 the ystem should return you to the graphical login prompt.  If this appears, 
then you can be pretty sure things are working.  There's more tests to perform, 
though, so log back in.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Run glxinfo and see what it says for server glx vendor string and
OpenGL vendor string.  Both should say NVIDIA Corporation.  If this says
anything to do with Mesa or mesasoft, then the GL and GLU libraries still
aren't configured correctly.  You need to go into /usr/lib and ls -l libGL*.
 You should see a libGL.so.1.0. &lt;NVIDIA release number&gt; and a libGLcore.so.1.0.
&lt;NVidia release number&gt;, plus a libGLU.so.1.3. You will probably have
other files too - and what you want is for the soft links of libGL*.so and
libGL*.so.1 to point to the respective NVIDIA files.  If you've installed
Mesa before, you can remove that rpm now - you don't need that any more.
 You can then make these soft links by hand, e.g.: ln -s libGL.so.1.0.5336
libGL.so, etc, for each link you need, and for whatever version number you
actually installed.  It's been suggested that just running the NVIDIA installer
again helps here, but that doesn't appear to do the job for the system-provided
libGLU.so. So you're going to have to do this anyway, and it saves you dropping
to init 3 again.</p>

<p>
<b>Your end result:</b>
</p>
<p>
What you want in the end is something that looks like this (ls -l libGL*):	
</p>
 
<blockquote><small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">lrwxrwxrwx
 ... libGLcore.so.1 -&gt; libGLcore.so.1.0.5336</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 -rwxr-xr-x ... libGLcore.so.1.0.5336</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 -rw-r--r-- ... libGL.la</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 lrwxrwxrwx ... libGL.so
 -&gt; libGL.so.1</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 lrwxrwxrwx ... libGL.so.1
 -&gt; libGL.so.1.0.5336</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 -rwxr-xr-x ... libGL.so.1.0.5336</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 -rw-r--r-- ... libGLU.a</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 -rwxr-xr-x ... libGLU.la</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 lrwxrwxrwx ... libGLU.so
 -&gt; libGLU.so.1.3</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 lrwxrwxrwx ... libGLU.so.1
 -&gt; libGLU.so.1.3</font><br />
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">	 -rwxr-xr-x ... libGLU.so.1.3</font><br />
    </small></blockquote>
</li>
 
  <li><p>Having done all this, try glxinfo again. It connects to the X server,
as a graphical application would, so if run as root, run xhost +localhost
as the user who logged in, and "export DISPLAY=:0" as root first.  With luck
this is reporting the correct NVIDIA stuff now. </p></li>
   
  <li><p>This is where we re-run <i>xscreensaver-demo</i> or whatever you ran 
last time to see the 3D performance.  Do the same thing again now and see 
whether things are really faster or not.  Hopefully, you'll be pretty much
 amazed!</p></li>
