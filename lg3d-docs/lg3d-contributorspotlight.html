        " The LiveCD idea was brought into discussion in October 2004 by
        Pierre. I have started working on the project in spring 2005 and
        needed roughly half a year until I had a usable prototype. On the one
        hand this was due to me getting lost in debian package dependencies,
        on the other hand I am still visiting school (I will take my final
        exams in summer 2006) and have only very limited spare time in which I
        can contribute to the project. However I have been learning much during
        my work on the LiveCD and this work is certainly far from being
        finished. "

        As you can see above, Christian is the person who has been working 
        hard on the implementation of LG3D LiveCD.  Recently he created 
        LiveCD ver. 2.3, which generated a great amount of interest from all 
        over the world.  His work helped many more people to experience LG3D.

        project, implementing a generic method for start menu applications,
        and number of models that show the capabilities of start menus that
        could be used in LG3D. Even before SoC had started Colin was

        of discussions, and implemented changes to the API of LG3D, working
        together with other community members. (September, 2005)

        I was pretty excited about it but I tought : "Oh my god, what kind 
        of monster computer is hidden behind the scene ?". After that 
        I discovered that it had become a GPL project on java.net. 
        So I downloaded it and tried it right away. What a great surprise 
        to discover that it was running smoothly on my "common" computer ! 
        (Who said that Java was slow ?). I really believe that Looking Glass 
        is _the_ next generation desktop, It brings freshness and innovation 
        in a sector that was kinda "dead" for me. And that's why I try to 
        participate as much as I can ! "

        I'm sure that everyone is impressed by Dwarfy's enthusiasm and
        contribution to the project.  Lots of testing, the Game of Life 
        incubator project, sharing cool ideas, and leading a number of 
        forum discussions.  His contribution to make the project more
        active has been just outstanding.

        " It's been 10 years since I began to use Java. I still love to
        use Java. I've been excited by brand-new Java technologies
        that appears every day.
        Needless to say, my favorite Java technology is the Project Looking
        Glass. I made image viewer - Zoetrope, however, I still have
        various ideas of LG3D application. I'd like to realize the ideas in
        the near future. In addition, I continue to open the LG3D documents
        to the public on my web site

        Many people would associate Yuichi with the cool image viewer, Zoetrope.
        In addition, he is contributing to the Japanese translation project
        and writes articles on LG3D for magazines.  He has been a great LG3D
        evangelist since the early days of the project.

        where my focus was mostly on Image Processing. I spent my next seven 
        years at Picker International  (now Phillips Medical Systems) where I 
        worked on developing a Radiation Treatment Planning system on a custom

        working on various projects including the Java Advanced Imaging API and 
        a collboration tool for accelerated sharing of OpenGL applications . My 
        previous project involved developing a framework for transparently 
        running h/w accelerated OpenGL applications on a backend server and 
        shipping (compressed) pixels to the desktop client. This work has been 
        folded into the VirtualGL 
        (<a href="http://virtualgl.sourceforge.net">http://virtualgl.sourceforge.net</a>) 
        project.
        I have always been in interested in Graphics/Visual/UI stuff and am a 
        big fan of Java and so I am really glad to be working on the Looking 
        Glass project."
