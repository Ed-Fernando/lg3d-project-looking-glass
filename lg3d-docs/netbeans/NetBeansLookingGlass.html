<h2>Building and Running Project Looking Glass with NetBeans</h2>
<p>
This document illustrates how
easy it is to get a development environment up and running for the
java.net Project Looking Glass with NetBeans. As you will read in this
document, using NetBeans as the development tool for building and
running Project Looking Glass makes Project Looking Glass development
very simple.
</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
To get started you will first need to
set up your environment. Once you have verified that your environment
is set up correctly you will be ready to build and run Looking Glass
from NetBeans.
</p>
<h4>Platform Requirements</h4>
<p>
Before you start setting up your
Project Looking Glass development environment, first check to make
sure your system meets the following minimal requirements.

<h4><a name="Configure_the_color_depth_of_your"></a>Configure the color
depth of your display</h4>
<p>
The Project Looking Glass Developer's Release requires a color depth of
at least 24 bits. Many systems are configured by default with 16 bit
color depths and the Project Looking Glass Developer's Release will not
run correctly at
this depth. You can identify the current display depth by running the
following command:
</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
% xdpyinfo | grep "depth of root"<br>
depth of root window:&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 planes<br>
  </span></blockquote>
<p>
If you see a value lower than 24, you must change the color depth. The
process for changing the color depth varies by platform. Refer to the
configuration instructions for your platform below:
</p>
<h4>Java Desktop System 1 and 2, and SUSE8.1:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>From within a desktop session, run the sax2 command:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">%
/usr/X11R6/bin/sax2<br>
SaX: root Password:</span> <b>enter root password</b><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In the SaX2 application, click on <b>Color and Resolution</b>
then click the <b>[Properties...]</b> button for the
currently configured desktop.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Color selection...</b>
panel, click on the the menu and choose <b>16.7 Mio. [24 Bit]</b>. <br>
  </li>
  <li>On the <b>Resolution(s) for 16.7
Mio. [24 Bit] colors</b> tab, select the preferred resolution for
your desktop and press <b>[Ok]</b>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <b>[Finish]</b>
button, then <b>[Finalize&gt;&gt;]</b>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The <b>SaX2 final steps...</b>
dialog will open. Click the <b>[Test...]</b>
button to test the new resolution. <br>
  </li>
  <li>A blue test screen should appear, click the <b>[Save]</b> button
if the display appears
to be stable, and then <b>[Ok]</b>
when you return to the SaX2 window, followed by <b>[Yes]</b> to exit
from SaX2.</li>
  <li>If the test screen did not appear correctly, the test will exit
after 30 seconds and your previous desktop session will be restored.
You should then try alternate resolutions at the 24 bit color depth to
find a resolution that works for your system.<br>
  </li>
  <li>When you are satisfied with the settings, log out and re-login to
your desktop session and verify that the color depth is now 24 bit or
higher using the <span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">xdpyinfo</span>
command above.</li>
</ol>
<h4>RedHat Fedora 2:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>First become root:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% su root<br>
Password:</span> <b>enter root password</b> <br>
    <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">#</span><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">DefaultDepth
24<br>
DefaultFbBpp 32<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li>Save the file and then logout and re-login to your desktop
session and verify that the color depth is now 24 bit or higher using
the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">xdpyinfo</span>
command above.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>RedHat 8, RedHat 9 and other Linux platforms:</h4>
<p>
Many Linux platforms use the <span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">XF86Config</span>
file to
configure the display properties. To change the color depth on these
systems:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>First become root:<br>

<h3>Using NetBeans to Build and Run Looking Glass</h3>
<p>
Now that you have the necessary
environment to build Looking Glass, you are ready to launch NetBeans,
get the Looking Glass source code, build Looking Glass from source
and run Looking Glass all from within NetBeans.
</p>
<h4>Launching NetBeans</h4>
<p>To launch NetBeans, simply type
netbeans at the command prompt in a terminal window:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: courier; margin-left: 40px;">
% netbeans</p>
<p>The above command will launch the
NetBeans IDE.</p>
<h4>Getting the Looking Glass Source Code</h4>
<p>
The next step is to configure the
NetBeans IDE to retrieve the Looking Glass source code from the
java.net CVS repository. There are three Looking Glass CVS repositories
which you must retrieve source file from, <b>lg3d-core</b>, <b>lg3d-demo-apps</b> and <b>lg3d-incubator</b>. 
The steps to setup and retrieve source files in
NetBeans is described in the next three sub-sections, Getting the
lg3d-core source, Getting the lg3d-demo-apps source and Getting the lg3d-incubator source.
</p>
<h4>Getting the lg3d-core source</h4>
<p>
In the NetBeans IDE, from the main menu
select CVS &gt; Checkout as shown in Figure 1 below.
</p><br>
<img name="Graphic1"

</p>
<p>
Mark the checkbox next to the label "Do
Not Show This Dialog Box Again" as shown in Figure 2 above and
press the "Check Out" button.
</p>-->
<p>
Next you will see the "CVS Checkout"
dialog. There are several values you will need to enter on this
screen. Each of the values below should be entered in this screen.
</p>
<pre>    CVS Server Type: pserver<br>    CVS Server Name: cvs.dev.java.net<br>    Port: 2401<br>    User Name: <i>&lt;enter your java.net user name&gt;</i>
    Repository Path: /cvs
</pre>
<pre>    Password: <i>&lt;enter your java.net password&gt;</i>
</pre>
<p>Your CVS Checkout form should look very
similar to the one shown in Figure 2 below.<br><br>
<img src="images/NetBeansLookingGlass_html_Figure2.png"

<pre>    Working Directory: <i>&lt;source path where to place Looking Glass source files&gt;</i>
</pre>
e.g. /home/&lt;user_name&gt;/my-lg3d<br>
    <br>
<font color="#800000"><b><i>Remember this directory path, you will need
to enter it again later</i></b></font>
<!--<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: The Revision or
Tag field you should enter for the latest release would be dev-0-7-0
instead of dev-0-6.2 so that you check out the most recent revision.<br>
</p>
<p>
Notice the label "You are not logged
in." below the Password field and Login button. Press the Login
button now. The label will change to "You are logged in".
</p>-->
<p>
The final CVS Checkout form should look very
similar to the one shown in Figure 3 below.<br><br>

<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 14 lg3d-core</i></font>
</p>
<p>
You now have successfully loaded the
Looking Glass project into NetBeans. You are now ready to build
Looking Glass in NetBeans.
</p>
<h4>Building the Looking Glass Project in NetBeans</h4>
<p>
In the NetBeans project window, right
click on the lg3d-core project and select "Build Project as shown
in Figure 15 below.
</p>
<img src="images/NetBeansLookingGlass_html_Figure15.png"
 name="Graphic15" border="0">
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 15 Build Project</i></font>
</p>
<p>
This will initiate a build of the
Looking Glass project. You will notice in the bottom of the NetBeans
IDE, the output window will show the results of building the Looking
Glass source files. An example NetBeans output window from building
Looking Glass is shown in Figure 16 below.
</p>

 name="Graphic16" border="0">
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 16 Looking Glass build output</i></font>
</p>
<p>
When the build of Looking Glass has
completed, you will see a status message at the bottom of the output
window saying it has finished building Looking Glass.
</p>
<p>
You have now successfully built Looking
Glass in NetBeans. Next you will run the Looking Glass window manager
from NetBeans.
</p>
<h4>Running Looking Glass Project in NetBeans</h4>
<p>
To run the Looking Glass window manager
from NetBeans, right click on the lg3d-core project and select the
"Run Project" option as shown Figure 17 below.
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 17 Running Looking Glass</i></font>
</p>
<p>
If you have configured your environment
for running the Looking Glass window manager as described in this
document and you have successfully built Looking Glass in NetBeans,
you will see a window running the Looking Glass window manager which is
very similar to that shown in Figure 16 below. There are additional
applications being added to the Looking Glass window manager at the
time of this writing. So, the applications shown on the task bar may
differ slightly from those shown in Figure 18.

</p>
<p>
Notice that by clicking the CD icon on
the taskbar it will open the CD viewer, a 3D demo application. If you
mouse over the stack of CDs and click on the CD images you will see
the application in action.
</p>
<p>
For additional operational information,
click the icon to the right of the CD Viewer on the taskbar. This
will open a panel that summarizes the operations supported by the
demo. Note that the left most icon, a computer, launches an xterm
window. This item demonstrates X11 application integration and may
not work in all configurations.
</p>
<p>
The far right icon, skull and cross
bones, when clicked will exit the Looking Glass window manager.
</p>
<p>
That's all there is to having an
environment where you can build and run the Looking Glass window
manager. Fun isn't it?<br>
</p>

<h3>Setting up a NetBeans Project for Looking Glass Demo Apps<br>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Now that you have enjoyed the ease at which you can build and run
Looking Glass in NetBeans, it is time to setup a NetBeans project so
you can make modifications to the lg3d-demo-apps in addition to being
able to modify the source code of lg3d-core.<br>
</p>
<p>Early in this document you retrieved the source files for
lg3d-demo-apps in the section title, "Getting the lg3d-demo-apps
source". In this section you will setup a NetBeans project so you can
make modifications to the lg3d-demo-apps, see those changes by
rebuilding and running Looking Glass in NetBeans.<br>
</p>
<p>To setup a NetBeans project for lg3d-demo-apps, you tell NetBeans to
create a new project as shown in Figure 19 by selecting File &gt; New
Project from the main menu.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure19.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 227px; height: 41px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 19 Create a New Project</i></font><br>
</p>
<p>After selecting the File &gt; New Project menu item, the NetBeans
IDE will launch the New Project wizard. In the New Project wizard
select the General Category and Java Project with Existing Sources
project type as shown in Figure 20.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure20.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 627px; height: 439px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 20 Choosing a General Java Project with
Existing Sources</i></font><br>
</p>
<p>Press the Next button to go to the Name and Location screen of the
New Project wizard. Enter a project name. I chose a project name of
"lg3d-demo-apps-nb-prj". Enter the path to the directory of the
lg3d-demo-apps source. The lg3d-demo-apps source is the directory you
specified&nbsp; in the "Getting the lg3d-demo-apps source" section.
Then, uncheck the "Set as Main Project" check box.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> If you forget to uncheck the "Set as Main
Project" check box, you can
always set the lg3d-core project as the main project in the Projects
window at any
time by right clicking on the lg3d-core project and selecting the "Set
Main Project" option.</span></p>
<p>An example screen shot of the New Project wizard for the directory
where I placed the lg3d-demo-apps source is shown in Figure 21.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure21.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 628px; height: 315px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 21 New Project Name and Project Location<br>
</i></font></p>
<p>Press the Next button to go to the Existing Sources screen of the
New Project wizard. On the Existing Sources screen you tell NetBeans
where to find source files for the lg3d-demo-apps.<br>
</p>
<p>Add the lg3d-demo-apps source folder by clicking on the Add Folder
button for the Source Package Folders. Traverse to and select the
lg3d-demo-apps/src/classes directory. Example screen shot for my
development environment is shown in Figure 22.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure22.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 640px; height: 375px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 22 Location of lg3d-demo-apps sources<br>
</i></font></p>
<p>Press the Finish button to leave the New Project wizard.<br>
</p>
<p>In order to leverage NetBeans syntax highlighting, code completion
and instant compilation, we need to tell NetBeans where to find the
lg3d-core class files which the lg3d-demo-apps depends upon. You do
this by right clicking on the newly created project for lg3d-demo-apps
in the projects window and selecting the "Properties" option as shown
in Figure 23.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure23.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 327px; height: 353px;"><br>
<font size="2"><i>Figure 23 Selecting lg3d-demo-apps project properties</i></font><br>
</p>
<p>Tell tell NetBeans where to find the dependent lg3d-core class
files, on the Project Properties window, select "Libraries" for
Categories and select the "Compile" tab as shown in Figure 24.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure24.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 681px; height: 363px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 24 Selecting compile time libraries</i></font><br>
</p>
<p>Click on the "Add Jar/Folder" button to add the
lg3d-core/build/classes directory.&nbsp; Traverse to and select the
lg3d-core/build/classes directory. The path to this directory will be
the one you specified as the directory in the "Getting the lg3d-core
source" section earlier.</p>
<p>An example screen shot showing the path to lg3d-core directory I
used is shown in Figure 25.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure25.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 679px; height: 361px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 25 Selecting compile time libraries</i></font></p>
<p><br>
Press the "Ok" button to leave the "Project Properties" wizard. You
will see NetBeans update lg3d-demo-apps classpath information with the
lg3d-core class files.<br>
<br>
Expand the lg3d-demo-apps project to the source file
org.jdesktop.lg3d.apps.tapps.WebIcon.java as shown in Figure 26.</p>
<p><img src="images/Figure26.png" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 397px; height: 337px;"><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2"><i>Figure 26 Expanding the lg3d-demo-apps source tree<br>
<br>
</i></font>Double click on the WebIcon.java file to load it in the
NetBeans editor. You can make edits to this file and compile it
directly by either pressing the shortcut key "F9" or by selecting the
Build &gt; Compile menu item.<br>
<br>
You can edit any file under the newly created lg3d-demo-apps project
and compile it. To test your modifications or changes to any of the
lg3d-demo-apps source code in the Looking Glass window manager, just
right click the lg3d-core project in the projects window and select
"Run Project" or select "Run &gt; Main Project" from the main
menu.&nbsp; Or, you can simply press "F6" to compile the edited file.
Remember the lg3d-core project is the project you run the Looking Glass
window manager with. It will automatically pick up your modifications
to the lg3d-demo-apps project.<br>
