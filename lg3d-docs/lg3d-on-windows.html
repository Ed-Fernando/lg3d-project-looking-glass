<h3>Running the Project Looking Glass Developer's Release on Microsoft Windows</h3>
 
<p>
  <b>Project Looking Glass runs on Windows!</b>
</p>
  
<p>
  Running Project Looking Glass (LG3D) on Windows is very easy :-)
  The core part of LG3D is built using platform independent Java technology 
  which means that it can run on many platforms.
  So, it runs on Windows (although there are some limitations).
  In order to simplify the installation process significantly,
  the LG3D Installer exe has been released.
  This document describe how to install and run LG3D on your Windows system 
  using the installer.

<h3><a name="Requirements"></a>1. Platform Requirements</h3> 

<p> 
  First check to make sure your system meets the following minimal requirements: 
</p> 

<center><small>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="90%"> 
      <tr> 
        <th valign="top">Component</th>

        <td valign="top">Tested on Windows XP and Windows 2000</td> 
      </tr>

        <td valign="top">1.4 GHz or faster recommended</td> 
      </tr>

      <tr> 
        <th valign="top">Graphics Card</th> 
        <td valign="top">3D accelerated graphics card, with at least 16MB VRAM and driver support for OpenGL, version 1.3 or greater.

          </ul> 
          <p>
            If you are successful in getting LG3D to run 
            on other cards, or want to report problems with specific cards, 
            please let us know using

<h4><a name="Limitations"></a>Limitations on Windows</h4> 

<ul>
  <li><b>No Windows Native App in 3D Space...</b>
<p> 
  Although LG3D for Linux and Solaris includes support for running 
  native applications within the LG3D desktop, 
  this feature is not available for the Windows release.
  This menas that it is not possible to run native Windows applications 
  within LG3D.  You can, however, develop and run 
  and develop LG3D applications, such as the CD viewer and other 
  LG3D Java applications. 
  In other words, the Windows version is designed for experience LG3D 
  and app development, but not for replacing Windows desktop.
</p> 
  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Downloading"></a>2. Downloading LG3D Installer</h3> 

<p>
  LG3D Installer for Windows installs everything you need to run LG3D,
  including JRE and Java 3D.  
  Although it is pretty big, it simplifies your installation process 
  (so please bear with the download time!).
</p>
<p>
  The Installer can be downloaded from the following link:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/files/documents/1834/42515/lg3d-daily-1.0.0_beta1-win32-i686-0610191253-setup.exe">

        LG3D Release 1.0.0 Beta 1 Windows Installer (19 October 2006) 
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Download the Installer <tt><b>exe</b></tt> file.
  Other builds can be found in the Stable build section on 
  <a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html">
    the binary build page
  </a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="Installation"></a>3. Installing LG3D</h3> 

<p>
  The LG3D Installer installs LG3D and all the necessary components including
  JRE and Java 3D.  It also adds an LG3D folder to the Start menu.
  Note that the installer puts JRE and Java 3D in an LG3D specific folder.  
  So, the installation doesn't alter existing Java environment you might
  already have.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Locate the saved Installer exe file and execute it.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Windows may display a dialog window that mentions 
    "Security Warning" regarding runing this exe file
    because of "Unknown Publisher".
    Click "Run" in the dialog window in that case.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    The installer shows License Agreement.
    Read through it, and click "I Agree" button if you agree with it.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    The insaller askes you an Installation Folder.
    Select a foler to install LG3D, then press the "Install" button.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    It shows installation progress.
    When completed, click the "Close" button.
  </li>  
</ol>

<p>
  After successful installation, you should see the "LG3D Project" entry
  in the Start menu, that includes LG3D launcher, uninstaller, and a shortcut 
  to the LG3D website.
</p>

<img src="images/windows/f10-lg3d-win-s.png" width="200" vspace="8" hspace="8" style="float: right;"/>

<p>
  After successful installation, you can launch LG3D from the Start menu:
</p>
<blockquote><b>
  Start -> Programs -> LG3D Project -> Start LG3D Project
</b></blockquote>

<p>
  Click the launcher.  
  After a few seconds, the LG3D window should appear.  Congratulations!

<h3><a name="Troubleshooting"></a>5. Troubleshooting</h3> 
<blockquote>
<h4>Screen update is very slow</h4>
<p>
The graphics card on your machine may not be fast enough for running LG3D.
Try "Medium (16 bit)" color mode by:
<tt><b>Right-click on the background
        ->select "Properties"
        ->select "Settings" in the "Display Properties" window
        ->select "Medium (16bit) in the "Color quality" selection</b></tt>.
