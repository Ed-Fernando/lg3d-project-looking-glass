<h3>How You Can Contribute</h3>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can contribute to Project Looking
Glass:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Try out the binary release</b><br />
You can download the binary release
of Project Looking Glass from the <a
 href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents
&amp; files</a> section of the lg3d-core project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Participate on Forums and Mailing Lists</b><br>
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=56">Project
Looking Glass forums</a> and of <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=112">Project Wonderland forums</a>
mailing lists provide a way for people
using the software to benefit from each other's expertise. To really
be useful, these lists need <i>your</i> input! Please don't be afraid
to
post: help out others when you can, post your questions,
comments and ideas as you see fit. See the <a
 href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/#Staying_Connected">Staying
Connected</a>
section on the lg3d-core page for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>File a Bug Report</b><br />
Bug reports are very helpful to developers, and a great way to
contribute to a project! Please use the <a
 href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue
Tracker</a> in the lg3d-core
project to file bugs (defects). Remember to take a little time when <a
 href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/#Reporting_Issues">filing
a bug report</a>;
make sure you can
reproduce the problem, and be very explicit in your description of the
problem. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>File an Enhancement Request</b><br />
If there's something you'd like to see in a project and don't, or
something you can imagine improving, let us know by filing an
enhancement request. Use the <a
 href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue
Tracker</a> and file
an "Enhancement" rather than a "Defect". </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Contributing Code to lg3d-core</b><br />
As mentioned above, all of the source code is available, and if
there's a feature you'd like to see, or a bug you'd like to see fixed,
you have the power to make that happen. In order to directly contribute
source code, you need to have a <b>Developer</b>
role in the project. However, before signing up for it, please consider
becoming a project <b>Observer</b>, downloading the source and
familiarizing yourself
with API
internals. Don't forget to <a href="#JCA">submit a Joint
Copyright Assignment</a> form if this is your first contribution.</p>
    <p>
The typical code update procedure we are practicing looks like the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        File a bug or request for enhancement using the 
        <a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">
        Issue Tracker</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discuss fixes using the "Additional comments" section of the
        Issue page.  It is a good idea to attach a patch to the Issue page.
        If you'd like to discuss the issue with wider audience,
        please use the
        <a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=56">
        Project Looking Glass forums</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Once we (at least including one of the project owners) agree on
        the changes, commit those to the master CVS.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
Although we sometimes don't follow these steps exactly, we'd suggest you
to follow them until you get accustomed to the codebase and making changes.
You may want to subscribe to the <b>cvs@lg3d-core.dev.java.net</b> and 
the <b>issues@lg3d-core.dev.java.net</b> aliases from 
<a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">
this page</a>
to see how things are going.
    </p>
  </li>
    <li>
    <p><b>Contributing LG3D Applications at the Incubator</b><br />
<a href="https://lg3d-incubator.dev.java.net/">
Lg3d-incubator</a> is the place for you to share your cool LG3D applications!
You can grow it together with the community if you wish.
If you want to start a new LG3D application development,
you are encouraged to post your idea at the
<a href="http://www.javadesktop.org/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=56">
Project Looking Glass forums</a>.  You'll get many informative feedback.
In order to upload your code and share it with the community,
you need to <a href="#JCA">submit a Joint Copyright Assignment</a> 
form if you haven't done so yet.
Then, you'll be granted a <b>Developer</b> role in the incubator project. 
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p><b>Contributing Web Contents</b><br />
We are looking for some help for enriching the web contents.
In order to directly contribute contents, you need to have a 
<b>Content Developer</b> (or Developer) role in the project.
Before applying for the role, please don't forget to submit 
a <a href="#JCA">Joint Copyright Assignment</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Translation</b><br />
You can also help by assisting in the translation of these pages 
as well as documentation. Work is being done on translating these pages 
to several languages as you see on the 
<a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/">lg3d-core front page</a>.
We would like to extend translation to 
include other languages so that we can grow the world wide LG3D community. 
In order to do this you need to have a <b>Content Developer</b> 
(or Developer) role. The procedure is the same as signing up 
for contribution of other code. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you'd like to start a new translation project to a language
        other than 
        <a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/index.html#Sub-projects">
          the ones listed as a on-going sub-project
        </a>,
