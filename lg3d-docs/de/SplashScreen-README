A.	DESCRIPTION.


This README describes a splashscreen, executed at start-up. - Operational within both the ./lg3d-dev and 
the ./lg3d-session environments. 
Upon first run of Project Looking Glass after an 'ant' compile, a SplashDefaults.XML file is created in the 
src/etc/lg3d directory. This default-set display consists of a pre-configured image and a text message, 
lasting for three seconds. For the purpose of personalisation, user preferences can be made to this xml file.


B.	CONFIGURING.


If a user wishes, changes can be made to this XML file in order to make Project Looking Glass more personal.
Although the XML file is self explanatory, the four settings are :
 
1. runSplash - A means to turn on/off the splashscreen (default = true)
2. showText - A means to turn on/off the display message option. (default = true)
3. imageLocation - The location of the image to be displayed (default = resources/images/splash/GrandSplash.png)
4. messageText - The text greeting to be displayed, if showText, above is set to <true> (default = "Welcome.")


C.	UPDATES.


	Changes made since v1.00.
